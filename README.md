# Lights On! 

Lights On! :sunny: is a WordPress theme for my writing blog, :underage: [Fandom Fadoodling](http://writing.nyx.zone/). This version is the dark text on light background one.

## Contribute

I do welcome opening an issue and/or making a pull request if you find a bug in the code. This is baby's first functional WordPress Theme, and I still have much to learn for sure, so please be kind!

## Licence

Lights On! is not ready for sharing and use by other WordPress blogs, as some of its functions are plugins-dependent. I'm mostly putting this repo up so that my friends at [Amassment](http://amassment.org/) can see the code involved in my custom theme for my fandom/writing blog.

:soon: I do plan to make a distributable version of this theme, but, not right now.

## Acknowledgements

None of this theme would have been possible without [Jeff Starr](https://perishablepress.com/)'s excellent book, [WordPress Themes In Depth](https://wp-tao.com/). In fact, I know much of my current WordPress coding knowledge to the writings of Jeff Starr and [Chris Coyer](https://css-tricks.com/). Many thanks!

The theme also relies on the CSS library [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/).
